## üöÄ Key Features of iMemoraise

iMemoraise is designed to enhance the management and tracking of Quran recitations for Academic Advisors and students. Here are the main features provided:

**For Academic Advisors:**

- **Recitation Management:** Monitor and track the progress of students' Quran recitations under their guidance. Review the completeness and accuracy of memorization progress.
- **Approval Process:** Listen to students' offline Quran recitations and assess their memorization progress, then approve or reject the recitations based on your assessment. Provide feedback directly to students to ensure they meet the required standards.

**For Students:**

- **Progress Tracking:** Keep an eye on the status of each recitation you‚Äôve submitted later, monitor your own progress and view updates on the status of your recitations based on feedback from Academic Advisors. Students submit their recitations offline, and no online submission is required.

## üë£ Usage Scenario

iMemoraise uses Keycloak for identity and access management. Keycloak handles authentication and authorization, providing secure access through its OAuth2 and OpenID Connect protocols.

**Here‚Äôs a simple scenario for logging in as an Academic Advisor or student:**

- **Account Setup:** Academic Advisors are assigned roles via Keycloak, which sets up accounts with default credentials. Advisors can reset their passwords for enhanced security.
- **Login:** Users authenticate via Keycloak using their credentials.
- **For Academic Advisors:** Manage and monitor offline recitations, approve or reject submissions based on your evaluation, then provide live feedback to students to help them meet the required memorization standards.
- **For Students:** Track your recitation progress and receive feedback on your offline submissions.
